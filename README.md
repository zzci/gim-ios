# GIM

GIM is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) messaging client for iOS, built with SwiftUI and the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk).

It is a fork of [Element X iOS](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios), rebranded and customized for the GIM platform at [g.im](https://g.im).

## Rust SDK

GIM leverages the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) through an FFI layer exposed as a [swift package](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-components-swift) that the final client can directly import and use.
